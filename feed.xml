xml:base="https://dulalsaurab.github.io/blog/2025/reflection-dreams/"><![CDATA[<p>Up and down hills, through forests and rivers, with birds chirping all around—it must have been a cloudy day when we went out for a walk. I can’t recall if it was purposeful or not. The roads, uneven and winding, were likely muddy; I remember navigating them carefully.</p> <p>There were three of us on the hike: me, her, and my brother. Almost the entire way, I found myself either walking behind them or ahead. Frustration, anger, and agitation churned within me, mixed with a strange, aching sense of longing. She walked with my brother, holding his hand for most of the journey. I knew there was nothing to be suspicious about—I trusted them both. She was mine, after all. Or was she? My confidence wavered, haunted by the past.</p> <p>Time becomes irrelevant when you think of love, when you breathe love, when you feel its warmth and togetherness. Yes, it sounds poetic, perhaps even fanciful, but it’s real. I know it is. My medical records, at least so far, declare me sane, and yet I’ve experienced love so profoundly that I can almost certainly say it’s real. And yet, as we walked, her warmth was directed elsewhere. She was engrossed in conversation with my brother, and I couldn’t help but feel envious. Why wasn’t she walking beside me, holding my hand, sharing her warmth with me after all these years?</p> <p>Finally, we reached a place that resembled a home but wasn’t ours. To my surprise, all our family members, even the distant ones, were there. Some kind of event was taking place, though it seemed irrelevant to me. My mind was entirely focused on her and the weight of things left unsaid. I was angry—furiously so—and my behavior toward her since we met had been less than kind. I knew why, and by now, you do too. But she seemed completely unaware. How could she not understand how much I wanted her to be with me after all these years? How could she take things for granted?</p> <p>She finally asked me, “What’s wrong? You’re not acting normal.”</p> <p>“Normal? What do you mean?” I snapped. “What does ‘normal’ even look like?”</p> <p>“You haven’t changed all these years,” she replied, her tone clipped. “Try a better answer.”</p> <p>So it was me, I thought. I was the one creating scenes. Still, the anger simmered within me, but eventually, I let it go. I don’t remember exactly how or why, but I chose to be happy again. It must have been a reunion after years of separation. My subconscious whispered that she had left me once before, and perhaps that was true. The mind plays strange games. It’s as though you know certain truths but choose to ignore them for the sake of bliss. Maybe I was doing the same.</p> <p>The house we were in sat atop a hill. The air was thick with fog and mist, and it must have been either dusk or dawn. The weather was chilly; I could tell by the clothes we were wearing. She wore black skinny leggings and a thin windbreaker or maybe a jacket. People gathered outside on the patio for reasons that didn’t concern me. My focus was on her. She sat on the ground, surrounded by others but apart from them in my mind.</p> <p>I walked closer, overwhelmed by feelings both familiar and pristine. I wanted to lie down on her lap, just as I had on our first outdoor date atop a hill surrounded by salla trees. I longed to look up at her through the curve of her bosom, the way I had done so many years ago. She looked stunning, even now. You know that feeling when you lie down and gaze at the sky, how deeply satisfying it is? Now imagine adding the presence of the person you love. It amplifies that bliss, making you feel as though you’re in the lap of a divine presence, completely free, stressless, and merged with your subconscious joy. That’s what I felt—exactly what I had felt long ago.</p> <p>I stood up and looked at her, noticing something new. She was aging. “You have wrinkles,” I said. “You’ve gotten old.” Then I turned to my brother. “Look, she’s getting old.”</p> <p>I knew I was old too. A long, long time must have passed. But then again, age is irrelevant when you encounter bliss. I looked at her and sang softly,</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>टाढा-टाढा कता-कता

Yet, every time I answered or heard my name called during attendance, I silently remembered the truth—but I never spoke of it.</p> <p>We all dance to an unknown music—omnisonic and celestial. We sense the mystery of life, an invisible thread connecting us to something greater, something profoundly spiritual. We hear its whispers, feel its presence, and recognize its quiet conspiracies, almost as if they guide our path, saving us time and again, offering insights for our next move. As we grow older, this truth becomes more evident.</p> <p>This is the story of the peculiar way I got into engineering college—woven with coincidence, passion, faith, and fate.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010, I dropped out of my BSc Physics program at St. Xavier’s and started preparing for the Indian Embassy Scholarship to study engineering at NIT in India. Back then, the Indian Embassy selected over 100 students based on an entrance examination for admission to NIT. I took the exam but failed to secure a spot. Completely dejected, frustrated, and unsure of my future, I went back home. I was no longer studying BSc Physics, and I had no idea what to do next. My parents, unfamiliar with higher education opportunities beyond what was available in the capital, couldn’t offer much guidance. They had never lived there, so they weren’t well aware of the available options.</p> <p>My elder brother was in Australia at the time. When he first left for Australia, the plan was for him to bring me there after high school. But after experiencing the harsh realities of life abroad, he advised me to complete my bachelor’s degree before considering moving. Financially, going abroad wasn’t an option either—our family wasn’t well off, and my brother was still studying and struggling in Australia. In the meantime, I thought about applying to IOE (Institute of Engineering), where a few of my seniors were studying. However, IOE’s entrance exam required months of rigorous preparation, and the next one was only 1.5 months away. I spoke with my parents about it, and they encouraged me to give it a try.</p> <p>“At least make an attempt. Something will work out,” they said.</p> <p>I pondered over their words—<em>something</em>… At that moment, I realized I had no other choice. Returning to BSC was no longer an option for me.</p> <p>I packed my bag—half a sack of rice, and some spices—and headed to Kathmandu. I joined PEA for entrance exam preparation. Those suckers made me pay the full amount, even though I was only going to study for a month in a three-month course. Every morning, I attended classes at PEA, and after that, I would head to Pulchowk Campus—the most prestigious engineering institute in Nepal. At first, I went there just to watch cricket. National and international matches were played there, and as a die-hard cricket fan, I couldn’t resist. But as I spent more time on campus, I started feeling something unusual—a strange mix of emotions. Looking back now, I realize it was a blend of motivation and something almost divine, a kind of blessing. I watched engineering students walking between their hostels and the main campus. Many wore old, worn-out clothes and flip-flops, yet their faces glowed with energy and excitement. Deep inside, I knew these were some of the brightest minds in the country.</p> <p>One particular Day, a wave of envy, mixed with a powerful surge of motivation, ran through my veins. I had never experienced anything like it before—it was in the air, in the serene greenery of Pulchowk’s campus grounds, surrounding me like an unspoken force. Slowly, I started planting the dream of studying there. I still remember the day I spoke with a few students on campus. That day, I silently prayed to God to give me an opportunity to study there. And so, my routine continued—mornings at PEA for preparation, afternoons at Pulchowk, soaking in the atmosphere, imagining myself walking those same paths as a student.</p> <p>After about a month of this ritual, the day of the entrance exam arrived. My exam center was Kathmandu Engineering College, Kalimati. I thought I would do okay in math, physics, and other subjects, but I knew my English was weak. I had always struggled with English. As expected, I did reasonably well in most subjects—except for English. Out of desperation, I tried sneaking answers from the guy sitting next to me. But later, I discovered that the exam had different question sets for students seated together. I was devastated when I realized this—I had lost all hope of getting into my dream college. But back then, my young mind didn’t dwell on it for too long. Then came the result day. Those days I used a UTL dongle for the internet—fuck that UTL (<a href="[https://link-url-here.org](https://newbusinessage.com/article/the-downfall-of-utl)">The Downfall of UTL</a>), it barely loaded a webpage. So, I had no choice but to travel two hours to the Pulchowk Campus, where the results were posted on the walls. To give you some context, Pulchowk offered various engineering concentrations. My dream was to get into Electronics Engineering—not because I had a deep understanding of it, but simply because I thought it was cool and had more physics in it. I was a huge fan of modern physics and Feynman, so electronics seemed like the obvious choice. At the time, securing a spot in Pulchowk meant ranking within the top 336 (48 in each Computer, 3xCivil, Mechanical, Electronics, and Electrical) out of thousands of applicants. The acceptance rate was less than 3%. I needed to be within that cutoff.</p> <p>But I wasn’t. I think my rank was above 350—I don’t remember exactly (probably 384?). But I was out. My dreams were crushed. That surreal feeling of faith and destiny shattered in an instant. Fate had other plans for me.</p> <p>Since my rank wasn’t too far from 336, I had a good chance of securing a full scholarship at a private engineering college. I visited Advanced Engineering College and was assured that I would receive a full scholarship. I thought, This isn’t too bad—I’ll get to study Electronics Engineering for free. Not bad at all.</p> <p>I coordinated with the college and got admitted. However, they had a strange rule—even though I was eligible for a full scholarship, I had to pay around 2 lakhs upfront during admission. They promised to reimburse the amount once the session started. I asked my brother for the money, he sent it, and I got enrolled. But deep down, I was still attached to the Pulchowk Campus. I could feel a fading voice within. I used to mutter, calm down buddy, we have no luck.</p> <p>Later, I discovered that I still had a minor chance of getting in. If some students decided to leave before classes started, the college would publish a second list, allowing the next eligible students—based on rank—to claim the vacant spots. When I heard this, my heart raced. Fuck, man, I still have a chance, you hang in there!</p> <p>From that moment on, I started checking the noticeboard every single day. One day, I saw it. There were a few vacant seats, IIRC 2, in Computer Science.</p> <p>Computer Science? Do I want it? I hated it during my short stay at St.Xavier College. “Print a Pascal’s Triangle in console, Turbo C”</p> <p>Fuck that—I’ll take it! It wasn’t too far off from Electronics, and more than anything, I just wanted to study at Pulchowk. I applied immediately. But applying didn’t guarantee admission. Others with better ranks could apply too, and they would have priority over me. So, after submitting my application, I prayed—honestly, I prayed. I even visited Pashupati Temple a couple of times.</p> <p>Then came the wait. I constantly refreshed the university website, checking if my name was on the list. Day 1—no name. Day 2—no name. The desperation and anxiety were killing me. I still remember checking almost every hour, even on weekends. It was a mental grind for a 19-year-old, thin, underweight, migraine-ridden boy. Five days passed—Sunday to Thursday—still no update. My 500MB UTL data pack ran out. At that point, I had lost all hope. Like, literally. On Friday, I decided to go to Pulchowk Campus—primarily to watch cricket. At the time, if I am not mistaken, the Cricket Association of Nepal had organized the National Championship as a selection tournament for the upcoming ICC Division 5. I reached the ground around 9 AM and watched an entire match. I even remember talking to Basanta Regmi, Nepal’s national team right-arm spinner. He acted modestly.</p> <p>On my way back, walking uphill from the field towards the main campus road, I met a guy named Kabindra Gautam??. We started talking, and I learned that he had been admitted to Pulchowk Campus for the upcoming session—either in Mechanical or Civil Engineering (I can’t recall exactly). I congratulated him and shared my story. He felt pity for me. Then, I mentioned my application to the secondary list, and that’s when the magic happened.</p> <p>He asked for my name again. “Saurab,” I said.</p> <p>“Oh! I think I saw your name on the secondary list in the administrative building,” he replied.</p> <p>I was shocked.</p> <p>“What? Are you sure?”</p> <p>“Yeah, I think so. I was there earlier—one of my friends had applied for the secondary list too, so I went with him. While checking, I noticed the name ‘Saurab.’”</p> <p>“Are you absolutely sure?” I asked again, my heart pounding.</p> <p>“Yeah, you better go and check.”</p> <p>It was Friday, around 2:30 PM.</p> <p>Hope and pray, hope and pray that my name is there. I sprinted towards the administrative building, barely able to breathe. And then—I saw my name.</p> <p>For the first time in my life, I cried—not out of pain, but out of pure joy and happiness. I can’t explain the feeling, but I’m sure some of you have experienced a similar emotion—that overwhelming mix of relief, gratitude, and disbelief. Wiping my tears, I rushed inside to understand the admission process.</p> <p>“Hello ma’am, I am Saurab Dulal. I’ve found my name on the secondary list, and I would like to know about the admission process.”</p> <p>“Oh, where have you been until now? Today is the last day for admission. Sunday, a new list will be posted, noting that the earlier list wasn’t satisfied, so other people will have a chance.”</p> <p>I explained,</p> <p>“I didn’t know my name was on the list, so I didn’t come earlier.”</p> <p>“Alright,” she said. “Now, you have 1 hour to complete your admission and reserve your seat.”</p> <p>“Okay,” I replied, trying to absorb the urgency. “What do I need to complete to reserve my seat?”</p> <p>“Take this form, fill it out, and bring two passport-sized photos along with your citizenship details. More importantly, you’ll need about 75 thousand rupees.”</p> <p>“What?” I said, stunned. “Where do I get 75 thousand in 1 hour? Can you please reserve the seat until Sunday morning?”</p> <p>“No, I can’t, even though I wish I could,” she explained.</p> <p>“I’m just administrative staff. The lists and vacancies are managed by another department, and they’re already closed for the day. So technically, it’s impossible to reserve your seat unless you do it today.”</p> <p>I felt my entire world crashing down. After everything I had gone through, this was my one chance to become a student at the college I had admired for so long. I felt broken. I begged her, but there was no way she could help me.</p> <p>She added, “If you can manage the money, we can sort out your documents — like your citizenship, next week. But to reserve your seat, the money is the most important thing.”</p> <p>My heart was racing. I was stressed—literally, I was about to burst. I had no idea how to get such a huge amount of money in such a short time. Who could I ask for 75 thousand?</p> <p>Brother? No, there’s no way I could contact him in time.</p> <p>Family? No, they don’t have that kind of money, and even if they did, it would be impossible to send it from Terai to the Valley in just 1 hour.</p> <p>Our brains work in strange, fascinating ways under stress, especially when hope is right there within reach but feels so far.</p> <p>I sat down on the couch, trying to think—How? How can I get 75k in one hour?</p> <p>And then, suddenly, an idea popped into my head. What if I go to Advance Engineering College and ask for the money I paid during my admission? Maybe I could bring it back here. Would it work? I wasn’t sure, but it was worth a try. A round trip from Pulchowk Campus to Advance College takes about 30 minutes. If I could somehow get them to give me the money within 30 minutes, I could rush back and complete my admission in time.</p> <p>I rushed back to the desk and begged her,</p> <p>“Could you please stay until at least 4 PM?”</p> <p>She had been observing me throughout this stressful moment and felt sympathy for my situation. She agreed.</p> <p>In Nepal, Friday is a half-day off, so almost all the staff were already gone.</p> <p>“Okay, I’ll be here on time, by 4,” I promised her, barely able to believe I might have a chance.</p> <p>I ran towards Advance Engineering College and reached in 13 minutes. I went straight up to the administrative department - third floor, explained my situation, and asked for the money I had paid for my admission. The response was blunt: “Denied.”</p> <p>Everybody who makes these decisions are in a meeting, and I would have to wait until it was over.</p> <p>“What?” I screamed, the second scream of the day.</p> <p>“I can’t wait! I need the money now!”</p> <p>There was no luck. Fifteen minutes passed with nothing but back-and-forth. I was extremely angry, but that didn’t help. I was dejected, my hope slipping away once again. I was so anxious, that I could feel my heart racing. I asked the guy,</p> <p>“Where is this meeting going on?”</p> <p>“Next building, second floor. But you can’t go there.”</p> <p>“I can,” I said. “This is now or never for me!” I don’t care anymore. I don’t want to study at your college!</p> <p>I rushed towards the other building, and that’s when I saw Prashant Sir, a teacher I had respected deeply during my coaching class at PEA. He was getting off his old bike. “Hello, Sir, I’m Saurab.” He didn’t remember me, and I understood. I explained my situation. He said, “Let me see what I can do.” Together, we went to the administrative building, 3rd floor. Since he was a board member, the administrative staff couldn’t deny his authority. He gave me the money—175,000 rupees. In that moment, tears dropped for the second time that day. But the money wasn’t exactly the full amount. I had paid 200,000 earlier.</p> <p>“Why 175,000?” I asked.</p> <p>The staff explained it was the campus rule—if you withdraw your application, 25,000 is deducted.</p> <p>“What?” I was furious. “25,000 rupees? That’s a huge amount!”</p> <p>To give you context, I had been living on 1,500 rupees a month in the valley, so 25,000 is more than an entire year’s worth of expenses. I started arguing, telling them I had never taken a class or used any resources from the college, so why should I pay that fee? The argument lasted for about five minutes. That’s when Prashant Sir intervened. “Look, Saurab, studying at Pulchowk is more important than this 25,000. I suggest you rush to the college, get your admission, and you can always come back and fight for the refund later.”</p> <p>I calmed down, thought, he is right.</p> <p>I took the check—but it wasn’t over. I rushed to the bank, cash it, and got the money. Thankfully, the bank was right in front of Pulchowk Engineering Campus. I got the cash and rushed to the administrative building.</p> <p>And then… another twist again. There was nobody in there.</p> <p>What the hell? It was 4:30 PM, and everyone had probably left since it was Friday.</p> <p>All my efforts, the rush, the fight, the tension—it all seemed in vain. I couldn’t reserve my seat. I was devastated again. That’s when a thought hit me: “If something can go wrong, it will go wrong.” I don’t remember who said it back then, but it jolted through my mind. I sat down on a wooden chair in front of the administrative room, completely alone. Nobody was around. I could cry. I did. This time, the tears weren’t of joy, but of despair and loss.</p> <p>A few minutes passed, and then I heard footsteps coming from the restroom. And that’s when I saw the MAM coming out. She looked at me and said,</p> <p>“Hait bhai, kasto dhila garya bhanya, yetro ber lagaune ho? Ma ta jhandai niski sakya theya, dhanna aaye chau.” ( Hey brother, why are you so late, taking so much time? I was about to leave, but I’m glad you came).</p> <p>It was as if the universe had conspired for me. At that moment, I thought of Paulo Coelho’s “The Alchemist”: “When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.” Deposit at Advance College, The cricket match, Kabindra Gautam, the secondary list, that MAM, Prashant Sir—all of these were part of the universe’s plan to help me.</p> <p>That day became the best day of my life. I was on cloud nine—ecstatic. I wish my family could have seen my face. Anyone who saw me that day must have known—I had hit the jackpot. Finally, I got admitted to Computer Science, Batch of 2010 (067). That’s why my roll number was 48, despite some being alphabetically before me.</p> <p>A fork in my universe, a fork that made me get into Computer Science.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="blockquotes"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[48th Roll Number - A Twist of Fate]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">octree Construction and Nearest Neighborhood Search(NNS)</title><link href="https://dulalsaurab.github.io/blog/2018/octree-construction-and-nns/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="octree Construction and Nearest Neighborhood Search(NNS)"/><published>2018-03-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-03-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dulalsaurab.github.io/blog/2018/octree-construction-and-nns</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dulalsaurab.github.io/blog/2018/octree-construction-and-nns/"><![CDATA[<style>.octree{height:400px;align-items:center;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}.otree{align-items:center;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}body{text-align:justify}</style> <p><strong>Note:</strong>: This is an archive post from 2013 and octree construction is used for NNS.</p> <p>Octree is a type of data-structure especially used for particle tracking in CFD(computational fluid dynamics) and also for the nearest neighbor search.

The reliability over UDP is achieved using Alternating Bit(AB) or Selective Repeat(SR) protocol. UDP, unlike TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), is an unreliable, connectionless data transfer protocol existing in the transport layer of TCP/IP architecture. The primary purpose of this project is to download a big file from a server residing in different IP location using one of these protocols i.e. either SRP or ABP.</p> <p><strong>Alternating Bit Protocol(ABP)</strong> is a connection-less protocol used to transfer one-directional the message between client and server. It is, in fact, the simplest form of a sliding window protocol where sequence number alternates between 1 and 0, and the window size is of one. In ABP, a request or ACK message is sent from a client to the server with AB 1 or 0, and upon receiving a response from the server, AB is flipped (1-0 or 0-1) and again a new request is sent with new AB info. If the desired response is not received from the server, a request is again sent by the client without flipping the AB. Thus, looking at the AB sent by the client, the server decides whether to send a new packet or to retransmitted the old one.</p> <p><strong>Selective Repeat Protocol(SRP)</strong> is also connectionless protocol. But unlike ABP, server parallelly sends a certain number of packets (default 10 in our case) for each new request from the client. Once receiving the packets from the server, clients somehow verify the sequence of the received packets. Upon verifying, the client can know about the missing packets – if there are any. The client sends a request for those missing packets and repeats the process until all the packets for a particular request are received. Otherwise, it requests for the fresh set of packets from the server.</p> <p>This project has implemented both Selective Repeat protocol and Alternating Bit protocol along with UDP. In regard to the project, a client makes an HTTP request to the server requesting a file to download. Server checks if the requested file exists or not. If the file exists, server splits the file into many segments of specific UDP length (say, 1024bytes). A packet is created for each split, which contains checksum as SHA1(20-byte hash of data), data length, sequence number, and/or alternating bit. The client, upon receiving the packet, verifies it, re-computing the hash, and performs a necessary action which may be saving the packet or requesting for retransmission. Retransmission can occur in various scenarios. Such as, if a packet is lost, or if a checksum is not validated, or if some sequence is missed –selective repeat case. All the action performed during this process are saved on a file and also are displayed in the console – i.e. both of client and server.</p> <h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2> <p>The application should consist a client program and a server program. The server program hosts files and responds to requests for files. It breaks the requested file into segments and sends them to the client over UDP. The client program takes a file name as input and requests the file from the server. The programs should handle UDP packet losses to make sure that the entire file is correctly received by the client program. The code needs to include implementation of the <strong>Alternating Bit</strong> and <strong>Selective Repeat protocols</strong>. Refer chapter 3.4 (Principles of Reliable Data Transfer) - Computer Networking, Kurose to understand these two protocols.</p> <p>The client program should print detailed information about any requests sent and data received at byte level (e.g., time X received byte Y to Z) during the file download. Server program should print detailed information about any requests received and data sent at the byte level. Client program and server program should be run on different machines in different networks.</p> <h2 id="architecture-description">Architecture Description</h2> <p>The top-level architecture of the project is shown below in figure 3.2. Basically, it contains a client process and a server process. The client process implements various methods via different classes such as client connection, transport, and file handler. Client connection creates a socket, handle requests and responses. It also holds some parameters, such as IP address, port number, message, an error bit, alternative bit handler and so on. Transport creates the packets, implements selective repeat and an alternating bit, verifies the received packets and so on. File handler performs necessary action to the packet sent by transport, it saves the packet or sends back the error message to the transport – if the file is not saved. In addition, the client process also contains methods such as exception handler, alternating bit and selective repeat handler, and so on.</p> <p>The server facilitates the file transfer process via various methods existing in different classes such as server connection, server packet, and file handler. Server connection creates a socket, send and receive requests and responses. Like the client connection, it also holds parameters such as IP address and port number of the client to sends back the response. File handler class checks if the requested file exists or not, if exist, it reads the file and divide it into no of the chunk of a specific size. Each chunk is sent to the server packet class, where the given chunk(data) is serialized, checksum, length, a sequence number is calculated. And finally, the packet is made ready to be sent to the client. Other various functions are also created on the server side such as selective repeat, alternating bit, exception handler etc. to support the file transfer process. Generally, these methods perform the same action as that of corresponding client functions. In addition to these, all the intermediate actions are printed on the client and on the server console. These actions include the requested file name, file status, sequence number sent and received and soon.</p> <h2 id="architecture-diagram">Architecture Diagram</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/Arctitech .png" alt="alt text"/></p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Figure: UDP file download system architecture

As UDP is an unreliable protocol, the reliability is added to the transfer process either by alternating bit or selective repeat protocol. Since these protocols are contrasting to each other, on them can be selected for the file transfer process.</p> <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p>Before the execution of client/server programs, it is very important to choose either selective repeat or alternating bit at first, and this can only be done by going to the code itself. It is very “important” to choose the same method on both sides, otherwise, program execution terminates or may continue on loop. Once the selection is done, the server program is executed first, and upon successful execution, it waits for the client request.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- execution of client/server program: &lt; python UDPClient/UDPServer.py &gt;</code></p> <p>Similarly, the client program is also executed and prompts the user to input the file name to download from the server. Now the client makes all the necessary setup up before sending a request to the server. A setup such as initialize server IP and port, bind IP and port to create an address, and finally create a socket.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)</code></p> <p>It also imports various global variables ( type, sequence counter, alternating bit etc. ) from the client config. The type variable tells sever if the request is of type acknowledgment or data. Sequence counter stores the information about all the received sequence number and an alternating bit to assist the same process. In case of SR, AB is always set to 1 and it acts as ACK message only. Upon completion of this setup, the client creates a UDP packet and sends a request to the server for the initiation of file transfer. The server receives the request, verifies if the file exists or not. If the file exists, it creates a small chunk of default size 1024 and stores it in a dictionary. Packets are created out of these chunks and are also stored in a dictionary. Each UDP packets created by server contains the following information</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- checksum : Check sum of the data

- length : Length of the data

- seqNo : Sequence number of the packet

- msg : Data or message to be send

- total_packets : Collection of all the packets

- total_number_of_packets : Total no of packets available 
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now, on the basis of the selected method, server start sending the packets, either 1 at a time in case of ABP, or 10 packets in case of SRP. Server response can be a new transmission of data or re-transmission in case of packet loss. Moreover, if the file is not found at the first hand, it sends a “file not found” exception to the client. Client waiting for server response, receives the packet (in some case it may not receive as well), send it to the transport for the verification of the packet. Transport, dissect the packet, calculate the checksum and length, verify it against the received parameters and upon verification, it sends the data to the file handler. And so, file handler writes the data to the file. During this process, the client may undergo time out or may receive distorted packets, in both of these cases it requests the server for the retransmission. The basic rule for retransmission in case of ABP is, if the received AB from the client is different than the one existing on the server, the server performs retransmission. Similarly, in case of SRP, the client notifies server about the specific missing packets, and server retransmits them. This process continues until all the packets from the server are received by the client. Client upon receiving all the packets from the server sends an ACK with type = ‘c’ (c for complete) to the server. Receiving ACK ‘c’ server closes the connection and terminates the transmission process with transmission complete message. There also exists some other helper functions such as exception handler – to track/handle, and print exceptions, missing sequence verifier - client process, to verify missing sequence in case of SRP and so on.

Moreover, to efficiently search such huge volumes of data, these search engines use numerous smart techniques and algorithms. Perhaps the most famous example is the PageRank algorithm to quantify the importance of a webpage. However, it was soon realized that determining the importance of a webpage alone was not enough. It was equally important to determine the relevancy (what the user exactly wants) of a webpage. It was Google which pioneered a technique for the same: personalization.</p> <p>Personalization in the context of search engines means to filter and re-rank search results based on users’ interests and past experiences. Concretely, a programmer is more likely to mean the programming language “C” in a search query “C interview questions” rather than the alphabet C. Personalization helps in delivering relevant results by either interpreting the search query or re-ranking the search results according to a “personal profile”. This profile is created by social media, online news portals and search engines according to searches carried out by a user,   selection of the results i.e. which link he clicks on and various other features or signals.</p> <p>Personalization in searching has conquered the challenges posed in searching caused by exponentially rising data. According to TechCrunch, Facebook is processing about 2.5 billion pieces of content and 500+ terabytes of data each day and there is a similar status for Google, Amazon, Twitter and other leading corporations. Another similarity among these big tech giants is that they use personalization techniques as a primary mechanism. However, it introduces a new problem of its own.</p> <p>Aptly termed “Filter Bubble” by author Eli Pariser in his book ‘The Filter Bubble: What the Internet is Hiding from You’, it is a phenomenon in which a user always ends up getting results resonating with is personal profile thereby getting “trapped” inside an information bubble created of his own. Pariser argues that these filter bubbles thus formed only show a user what he wants to see thereby separating im from contents that are in contrast to his interests. In a Ted Talk given by Pariser, he gives an example of how these bubbles impact the search results. In that example, he asked two of his friends to search for Egypt and send him the results. The result was surprising, one search result focused on olitical affairs of the country and the other (totally contradicting the first one) portrayed Egypt as a holiday destination.</p> <p>Complex unsupervised algorithms are used as the framework for personalization. Primary of these algorithms is clustering, where the search engine uses various features (from the users’ past queries to the computer he uses) as input to classify users into different clusters. This segregation f users creates different bubbles and hampers exchange of opinions among them thereby disallowing “civic discourse”. It is often argued just how much distortion personalization brings to the search results.  Some argue that personalization distorts only on the lower end results while others argue that it affects the top search results’ ranking.</p> <p>Another intimidating problem raised by filter bubble is the perception of quality in the search by a personalized user. As the user’s personalized profile is maintained by news sites, online vendors, social media, and search engines, they discern the search results as of high quality. Meanwhile, at the same time users are completely unknown of what is hidden from them by programmed gatekeepers.</p> <p>Unarguably, personalization is a necessity for efficient and relevant search results but it promotes these filter bubbles. Some search engines such as Duckduckgo market itself as free from filter bubbles but cannot outperform search giants such as Google when it comes to the relevancy of results. And even hough the most popular search engine, Google, has an option to turn off personalized search results, not many are aware of such feature. At the end, it’s a tradeoff between getting relevant search results and living inside an information bubble.</p> <p>In today’s world of growing data, personalization is indispensable for efficient search and relevancy. It has succeeded in creating the structured web content and has unequivocally brought significant benefit to the users. But at the same time, it seems to violate the ultimate goal of internet i.e. freedom in the quest for knowledge and information.</p> <p><strong>Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg says,</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>“A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa” - one of the probable baselines for Facebook tailored news feed.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the specific sense, this may be very true and in fact maybe what we want to hear but, simultaneously we are missing out on what we need to hear.</p> <p>Though the choice is ours - There is a vast difference between what we need to hear and what we want to hear.</p>]]></content><author><name>Saurab Dulal</name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="ComputerScience"/><category term="Eli Parser"/><category term="Filter Bubble"/><category term="Personalization"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Questions and Answers</title><link href="https://dulalsaurab.github.io/blog/2017/questions-and-answers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Questions and Answers"/><published>2017-03-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-03-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dulalsaurab.github.io/blog/2017/questions-and-answers</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dulalsaurab.github.io/blog/2017/questions-and-answers/"><![CDATA[<style>body{text-align:}</style> <h3 id="questions">Questions</h3> <p>what was before the before <br/> what will be after the after <br/> what is the sorrow in tears <br/> who is the joy in laughter?</p> <p>where dwells the mind curious <br/> who is the fury in furious <br/> why is a scene seen by the seer <br/> when is now, where is here?</p> <p>what is the reason in random <br/> why is the heat in hot <br/> who liveth in life <br/> what is, but naught?</p> <h3 id="answers">Answers</h3> <p>Before was there before the before <br/> after will be there after the after <br/> there are tears, and sorrow is just a fear <br/> there is laughter, and joy is just a share</p> <p>Mind dwells for the lost reminisce <br/> and the distraction acts fury in the furious <br/> no scene, but the hope is drift by the seer <br/> yesterday was now and rosy was here</p> <p>I can’t see when its dark <br/> I lost my grain when you were born <br/> I traveled far before with the sun <br/> I hound the self who live beneath <br/> <strong>null is all, and all is null</strong></p> <h3 id="ओम्-शान्ति---शान्ति----शान्ति">ओम् शान्ति - शान्ति - शान्ति</h3> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- Question By Pravesh Normal Koirala and Answer by Django Unchained</code></p>]]></content><author><name>Saurab Dulal</name></author><category term="Poems"/><category term="Poem"/><category term="Universe"/><category term="Quest"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
