I am fascinated by patterns of life, the evolution of humans, machines, and the self. I enjoy reflecting on the past, particularly events that have affected me and those around me, and exploring the consequences these incidents had on the people (friends, family), places (home), and objects connected to them. I love reading fiction, although I am not very skilled at writing. I read science to better understand the external world, and I explore spirituality to gain insight into the self and our connections.

I believe that computers are the most beautiful machines ever created by humanity, and I have dedicated most of my professional life to working with them.

Currently, I am a Security Engineer at Meta Platforms, where I focus on investigating and mitigating cyberattacks. I am passionate about various aspects of computing, including architecture, networks, links, applications, and more.
