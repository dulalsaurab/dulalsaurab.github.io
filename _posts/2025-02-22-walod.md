(Work In Progress)

Inception

I barely got to eat. Being the fourth child, a girl, and the daughter of a single mother who worked every hour to feed her kids, I almost lived on the street 
with three other hungry siblings—they were cute and lovely, though. This story wouldn’t have its depth without talking about my family, well, my family. 

I must have been two and a half years old when I first remember my mother’s face. I remember looking at her face for the first time when I was in her lap, staring upwards.
She was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life: a round face, and a nose almost like a triangle when viewed from the side. Bright, brown, perfectly shiny eyes.
Her mouth, when she laughed, resembled those of angels from heaven. She had silly, multi-colored hair—black, brown, and of course white. Even the wind couldn’t resist touching
her hair every chance it got. Her body was slim, and her palms were as pink as those of a newborn baby. She was the first love of my life. 

When I look back now, I realize how monumental it must have been for my mom to raise 4 kids with no husband, job, money, or home. Back then
